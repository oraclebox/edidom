# Introduction #
Inspired by JDOM, **edi-common** is both Java-centric and Java-optimized. It behaves like Java, it uses Java collections, it is completely natural API for current Java developers, and it provides a low-cost entry point for using EDI. 

## How to build ##
You need to install [MAVEN](http://maven.apache.org/), edi-common is using maven to manage project build. If you using eclipse, I highly recommend you to install [m2e](http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/).  
  
	mvn package
